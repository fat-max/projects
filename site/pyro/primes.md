# Primes

> Primes are critical pyrotechnic interface layers that ensure reliable ignition and controlled fire transfer between an ignition source and the main composition. By providing predictable initiation and timing consistency, they play a key role in system performance and safety and are therefore treated as regulated engineering components rather than effect-producing materials.

Primes are **intermediate pyrotechnic layers** applied to reactive or decorative components to ensure **reliable ignition and fire transfer**. Their primary function is to bridge the gap between an ignition source and a composition that may be difficult to ignite directly, providing consistent and predictable initiation under controlled conditions.

#### Conceptual Function

A prime typically:

- Is **more ignition-sensitive** than the main composition it serves
- Produces sufficient heat, flame, or sparks to initiate that composition
- Burns in a controlled manner rather than producing a visual effect

Primes are commonly used on elements such as stars, pellets, delays, or other subcomponents where uniform ignition timing is critical to overall performance.

#### System Role

From a system perspective, primes contribute to:

- **Ignition reliability**, especially in low-oxygen or high-velocity environments
- **Timing consistency**, ensuring effects occur as designed
- **Operational safety**, reducing the likelihood of misfires or partial ignition

#### Safety and Regulation

Because primes involve energetic materials and directly influence ignition behavior, their design, application, and use are **closely regulated** and subject to strict manufacturing and handling standards. In professional pyrotechnics, primes are treated as **functional engineering interfaces**, not as effect-producing compositions.

If you want this adapted to a **standards document**, **training manual**, or **short technical ingress**, I can tailor it quickly.
